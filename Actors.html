    <h2 class= "Ross">
        <div class="Ross2">Ross Geller</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        is one of the six main fictional characters of the NBC sitcom Friends, 
        <br>
        portrayed by David Schwimmer.
        <br>
        Ross is considered by many to be the most intelligent member of 
        <br>
        the group and is noted for his goofy but lovable demeanor.
        <br>
        His relationship with Rachel Green was included in 
        <br>
        TV Guide's list of the best TV couples of all time, 
        <br>
        as well as Entertainment Weekly's "30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples".
        <br>
        Kevin Bright, one of the executive producers of the show, 
        <br>
        had worked with Schwimmer before, 
        <br>
        so the writers were already developing Ross's character in Schwimmer's voice;
        <br>
        hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show.
